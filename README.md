# Top100
These data collect the top elected positions in Los Angeles County since 1960 by various demographics as coded by researchers at the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, CA.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this list is to document, explain, and examine the impact of the political inclusion of previously excluded groups in the Los Angeles County area.

Methodology
-----------
The political landscape in LA County includes elected offices at the federal, state, county, judicial, and municipal levels. Further subdivisions at the municipal level include school districts, special districts (i.e. water), and county central party committees. 

In LA County alone, this results in over 2000 elected positions. 

Positions that are included in this list are based on several criterion including:

    Constituent size
  
    Budget size
  
    Prestige of the position
  
    Career path
  
    Opinion of leaders
    
The positions include the following jurisdictions which are wholly or significantly enclosed within LA County.

    LA City Executives (i.e., Mayor, City Council, Controller, and City Attorney)

    LA County Executives (i.e., Board of Supervisors, Assessor, Sheriff, and District Attorney)

    U.S. House of Representatives (districts representing LA County)

    CA State Senate (districts representing LA County)

    CA State Assembly (districts representing LA County)

    CA State Board of Equalization (districts representing LA County)

    LAUSD Board of Education

    LACCD Board of Trustees

    Mayor of Long Beach

For the purposes of reporting, positions are ranked based on the above criteria. The relative rankings are as follow:

    Mayor of LA

    LA County Board of Supervisors

    LA County DA, County Sheriff, & LA City Attorney

    U.S. House of Representatives

    State Senate, Board of Equalization

    LA City Controller & County Assessor

    State Assembly & LA City Council

    LAUSD School Board

    LACCD Board of Trustees & Mayor of Long Beach

Data for this project starts in 1959, five whole years prior to the Watts Riots, a significant milepost in the role of demography in the history of modern Los Angeles. 

The number of positions included in this list vary due to decennial redistricting. From 1959 to 2016 the mean number of positions is 100 and the median number of positions is 101. 

For each year in each position, the name, race/ethnicity, and gender of every elected official is recorded. The start year of a particular elected official in a particular position is determined by the year the particular election for that position was won. The end year of a particular elected official in a particular position is determined by the year that official won an election in another position, lost an election in that same position, was termed out of that position, was removed from that position, retired, resigned, or died.

In rare instances where elected officials vacate their positions prior to a regularly scheduled election for that position and the governing body overseeing that position does not schedule a special election to fill that vacancy gaps in elected representation for that specific position may be observed.
